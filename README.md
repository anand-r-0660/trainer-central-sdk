# Trainer Central SDK

A React Native SDK for Trainer Central integration.

## Installation

```bash
npm install trainer-central-sdk
# or
yarn add trainer-central-sdk
```

## Usage

```javascript
import { openTrainerCentral } from 'trainer-central-sdk';

// Open the Trainer Central screen with parameters
openTrainerCentral({
  userId: '123',
  token: 'your-token',
  // Add any other parameters you need
});
```
```

After creating all these files, you can:

1. Open a terminal in VS Code (Terminal > New Terminal)
2. Run these commands:
```bash
# Initialize git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Login to npm (if not already logged in)
npm login

# Publish the package
npm publish
```

Would you like me to:
1. Help you with any specific file creation?
2. Guide you through the publishing process?
3. Explain how to test the SDK?
4. Add any additional features to the SDK?

Let me know what you'd like to focus on, and I'll help you with the next steps!
